## 3. Supabase Integration & Database Patterns

### Current Database Schema:
```sql
Core Tables:
- trading_signals (main production data)
- ml_training_samples (ML training data)
- ml_model_performance (model metrics)
- ml_generation_logs (batch processing logs)
- ml_indicator_weights (optimized weights)
- oanda_paper_trades (paper trading records)
```

### Database Connection Patterns:
```python
# Current Basic Pattern (needs improvement)
supabase = create_client(url, key)

# Recommended Production Pattern
import psycopg2
from psycopg2 import pool
import redis

# Connection Pooling
connection_pool = psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool(
    minconn=2,
    maxconn=20,
    dsn=DATABASE_URL
)

# Redis Caching Layer
redis_client = redis.Redis(
    host='redis-host',
    port=6379,
    decode_responses=True
)
```

### Database Optimization Recommendations:
1. **Connection Pooling**: Implement ThreadedConnectionPool (2-20 connections)
2. **Read Replicas**: Use Supabase read replicas for reporting queries
3. **Indexing Strategy**: Optimize indexes for symbol + timestamp queries
4. **Query Optimization**: Use prepared statements and batch operations
5. **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed weights and indicators

## 4. ML Model Serving API Architecture

### Recommended API Architecture:
```python
# Enhanced Flask Application Structure
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS
import tensorflow as tf
import joblib
import redis
import structlog
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

# Monitoring Metrics
prediction_counter = Counter('predictions_total', 'Total predictions')
prediction_duration = Histogram('prediction_duration_seconds', 'Prediction duration')

# Model Management
class ModelManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {}
        self.weights_cache = redis.Redis()
        self.load_models()

    def load_models(self):
        # Load LSTM models for each symbol/category
        pass

    def predict(self, symbol, indicators):
        # Optimized prediction with caching
        pass

# API Endpoints
@app.route('/health', methods=['GET'])
def health_check():
    return jsonify({
        'status': 'healthy',
        'models_loaded': len(model_manager.models),
        'database_connected': check_db_connection(),
        'cache_connected': check_redis_connection()
    })

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
@prediction_duration.time()
def predict():
    prediction_counter.inc()
    # Implementation with error handling
    pass

@app.route('/train', methods=['POST'])
def trigger_training():
    # Async training trigger
    pass

@app.route('/weights', methods=['GET'])
def get_weights():
    # Cached weights retrieval
    pass
```

### Production API Enhancements:
1. **Async Processing**: Use Celery for long-running training tasks
2. **Model Versioning**: Support multiple model versions simultaneously
3. **Request Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
5. **Circuit Breaker**: Fail gracefully when dependencies are down

## 5. Monitoring & Logging Strategy

### Comprehensive Monitoring Setup:

**Application Metrics:**
```python
from prometheus_client import CollectorRegistry, Gauge, Counter, Histogram
import structlog

# Structured Logging
logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Custom Metrics
model_accuracy = Gauge('model_accuracy', 'Model accuracy by symbol', ['symbol'])
prediction_latency = Histogram('prediction_latency_seconds', 'Prediction latency')
training_duration = Histogram('training_duration_seconds', 'Training duration')
error_count = Counter('errors_total', 'Total errors', ['error_type'])

# Health Check Endpoints
@app.route('/metrics')
def metrics():
    # Prometheus metrics endpoint
    pass

@app.route('/health/detailed')
def detailed_health():
    return jsonify({
        'status': 'healthy',
        'models': check_model_status(),
        'database': check_database_health(),
        'cache': check_cache_health(),
        'external_apis': check_external_apis()
    })
```

**Logging Strategy:**
```python
# Structured logging with correlation IDs
@app.before_request
def add_request_id():
    g.request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    logger = logger.bind(request_id=g.request_id)

# Log levels and patterns
logger.info("Prediction request",
           symbol=symbol,
           confidence=confidence,
           duration_ms=duration)

logger.error("Model prediction failed",
            error=str(e),
            symbol=symbol,
            traceback=traceback.format_exc())
```

**Monitoring Stack Recommendations:**
1. **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
2. **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
3. **Loki**: Log aggregation and search
4. **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and notification
5. **UptimeRobot**: External monitoring of API endpoints

## 6. Auto-scaling Strategy for Trading Operations

### Railway Auto-scaling Configuration:
```toml
# Enhanced railway.toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 2 --timeout 300 --worker-class gevent"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 30
restartPolicyType = "on_failure"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 5

# Auto-scaling settings
[deploy.scaling]
min_instances = 2
max_instances = 10
cpu_threshold = 70
memory_threshold = 80
response_time_threshold = 2000  # 2 seconds

[env]
PORT = "8080"
PYTHON_VERSION = "3.11"
WORKERS = "2"
WORKER_CLASS = "gevent"
MAX_REQUESTS = "1000"
MAX_REQUESTS_JITTER = "100"
PRELOAD_APP = "true"

# Performance tuning
REDIS_URL = "${{secrets.REDIS_URL}}"
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE = "20"
MODEL_CACHE_TTL = "300"
ENABLE_METRICS = "true"
```

### Intelligent Scaling Strategies:

**Time-based Scaling:**
```python
# Trading hours scaling
LONDON_SESSION = (8, 16)  # UTC
NY_SESSION = (13, 21)     # UTC
ASIAN_SESSION = (23, 7)   # UTC

def get_optimal_instances():
    current_hour = datetime.utcnow().hour
    if LONDON_SESSION[0] <= current_hour <= LONDON_SESSION[1] or \
       NY_SESSION[0] <= current_hour <= NY_SESSION[1]:
        return 6-8  # High traffic during major sessions
    else:
        return 2-3  # Lower traffic during off-hours
```

**Load-based Scaling:**
- CPU utilization >70%: Scale up
- Memory utilization >80%: Scale up
- Response time >2s: Scale up
- Error rate >5%: Scale up and alert

**Event-based Scaling:**
- Major economic news events: Pre-scale up
- Market opening/closing: Scheduled scaling
- Model training completion: Temporary scale down

## 7. Cost Optimization Strategy

### Railway Cost Optimization:

**Hobby Tier ($5/month):**
- 512MB RAM, shared CPU
- 500 hours/month usage
- Suitable for development only
- **Not recommended for production**

**Pro Tier ($20/month):**
- 2GB RAM, 2 vCPU cores
- Unlimited usage
- Auto-scaling included
- **Minimum for production**

**Scale Tier ($50/month):**
- 4GB RAM, 4 vCPU cores
- Better performance
- **Recommended for production ML workloads**

### Cost Optimization Strategies:

**1. Resource Optimization:**
```python
# Model quantization to reduce memory usage
import tensorflow_model_optimization as tfmot

# Batch processing for efficiency
def batch_predict(symbols, indicators_batch):
    # Process multiple symbols in single inference
    pass

# Model pruning for smaller footprint
pruned_model = tfmot.sparsity.keras.prune_low_magnitude(model)
```

**2. Caching Strategy:**
```python
# Redis caching for expensive computations
@cache.memoize(timeout=300)  # 5 minutes
def calculate_indicators(symbol, timeframe):
    # Cache technical indicators
    pass

@cache.memoize(timeout=3600)  # 1 hour
def get_model_weights(model_version):
    # Cache model weights
    pass
```

**3. Database Optimization:**
```sql
-- Partitioning for large tables
CREATE TABLE trading_signals_2024_01 PARTITION OF trading_signals
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

-- Materialized views for expensive queries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_signal_stats AS
SELECT
    symbol,
    DATE(created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as signal_count,
    AVG(confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM trading_signals
GROUP BY symbol, DATE(created_at);
```

**4. Scheduled Resource Management:**
```python
# Scale down during off-hours
def schedule_optimization():
    # 22:00 UTC - 02:00 UTC: Reduce instances
    # Weekend: Minimum instances
    # Major holidays: Reduced capacity
    pass
```
