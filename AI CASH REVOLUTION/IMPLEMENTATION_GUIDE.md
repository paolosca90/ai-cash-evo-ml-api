# AI Cash Evolution - ML System Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide provides a complete roadmap for transforming the current simplified Railway deployment into a production-ready ML trading system. The implementation spans multiple phases and requires careful coordination between infrastructure, database, and application components.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have Now
- **Simplified Railway App**: 26-line Flask application (`app.py`)
- **Location**: `railway-ml-service/` directory
- **URL**: https://web-production-31235.up.railway.app
- **Status**: Basic health checks working, no ML functionality

### What We Need to Build
- **Full ML System**: Complete LSTM-based trading signal generation
- **Real Architecture**: 312-line Flask application (`app_full.py`) with full ML capabilities
- **22 ML Scripts**: Training, optimization, backtesting, and monitoring
- **Production Infrastructure**: Containerized, scalable, monitored

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Week 1-2)

- `railway-ml-service/Dockerfile.inference` - Inference service
- `docker-compose.production.yml` - Local development stack

#### 1.2 Environment Configuration
```bash
# Create environment configuration
cp railway-ml-service/.env.example railway-ml-service/.env.production
```

**Required environment variables:**
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[supabase-connection-string]
SUPABASE_URL=https://rvopmdflnecyrwrzhyfy.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[your-service-key]

# Storage

```

#### 1.3 Railway Service Setup
Create three separate Railway services:

1. **ML API Service** (`ml-api`)
   - Build context: `railway-ml-service`
   - Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.production`
   - Environment: Production variables
   - Port: 8080

2. **ML Training Service** (`ml-trainer`)
   - Build context: `railway-ml-service`
   - Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.trainer`
   - Environment: Training variables
   - Port: 8081

3. **ML Inference Service** (`ml-inference`)
   - Build context: `railway-ml-service`
   - Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.inference`
   - Environment: Inference variables
   - Port: 8082

### Phase 2: Database Integration (Week 2-3)

#### 2.1 Supabase Schema Setup
Execute the SQL schema from `SUPABASE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`:

```sql
-- Connect to Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run all table creation scripts
-- Set up indexes for performance
-- Configure RLS policies
-- Create database functions
```

#### 2.2 Migration Script
Create `scripts/migrations/setup_ml_schema.sql`:
```sql
-- Complete ML schema setup
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
```

#### 2.3 Data Migration
```python
# scripts/migrations/migrate_existing_data.py
"""
Migrate any existing trading data to new ML schema
"""
```

### Phase 3: ML System Implementation (Week 3-4)

#### 3.1 Core ML Components
Ensure these files are properly implemented:

**Models:**
- `railway-ml-service/models/lstm_trainer.py` - LSTM training logic
- `railway-ml-service/models/weight_optimizer.py` - Weight optimization
- `railway-ml-service/models/predictor.py` - Prediction generation

**Services:**
- `railway-ml-service/services/database.py` - Database operations
- `railway-ml-service/services/data_processor.py` - Data preprocessing
- `railway-ml-service/services/predictor.py` - Prediction service

**Utils:**
- `railway-ml-service/utils/config.py` - Configuration management
- `railway-ml-service/utils/indicators.py` - Technical indicators
- `railway-ml-service/utils/model_registry.py` - Model versioning

#### 3.2 API Implementation
Replace the simple `app.py` with full implementation:

```bash
# Backup current simple app
mv railway-ml-service/app.py railway-ml-service/app_simple.py

# Use full implementation
cp railway-ml-service/app_full.py railway-ml-service/app.py
```

#### 3.3 Edge Functions
Deploy Supabase edge functions:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g @supabase/cli

# Initialize edge functions
supabase init
supabase functions deploy technical-indicators-advanced
supabase functions deploy ml-predict
supabase functions deploy trigger-model-training
```

### Phase 4: Training Pipeline (Week 4-5)

#### 4.1 Initial Model Training
```bash
# Connect to training service
curl -X POST https://your-trainer.railway.app/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"force_retrain": true}'
```

#### 4.2 Model Validation
```bash
# Validate trained model
curl https://your-trainer.railway.app/models
curl https://your-trainer.railway.app/training-status
```

#### 4.3 Weight Optimization
Run weight optimization scripts:
```bash
cd scripts/ml
python optimize_signal_weights.py
python optimize_from_real_trades.py
```

### Phase 5: Inference Service (Week 5-6)

#### 5.1 Deploy Inference Service
The inference service should:
- Load the trained model
- Handle real-time predictions
- Implement caching
- Monitor performance

#### 5.2 API Integration
Update frontend to use new inference endpoints:

```javascript
// Frontend integration
const response = await fetch('https://your-inference.railway.app/predict', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    symbol: 'EURUSD',
    indicators: {
      rsi_value: 65,
      adx_value: 28,
      ema_12: 1.0850,
      // ... other indicators
    }
  })
});
```

#### 5.3 Testing
```bash
# Test inference service
curl -X POST https://your-inference.railway.app/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol":"EURUSD","indicators":{"rsi_value":65}}'
```

### Phase 6: Monitoring & CI/CD (Week 6-7)

#### 6.1 Set up GitHub Actions
Create `.github/workflows/ml-pipeline.yml` with the workflow from the deployment pipeline document.

#### 6.2 Monitoring Dashboard
Set up monitoring endpoints:
- `/health` - Service health
- `/metrics` - Performance metrics
- `/models` - Model information

#### 6.3 Alerting
Configure alerts for:
- High latency (>1000ms)
- Model drift detection
- Training failures
- System resource issues
